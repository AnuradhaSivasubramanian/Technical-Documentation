          Carnatic music is a system of music commonly associated with southern
          India. It is one of two main subgenres of Indian classical music that
          evolved from ancient Hindu traditions, the other subgenre being
          Hindustani music, which emerged as a distinct form because of Persian
          or Islamic influences from Northern India. The main emphasis in
          Carnatic music is on vocal music; most compositions are written to be
          sung, and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be
          performed in gāyaki (singing) style.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carnatic music is usually performed by a small ensemble of musicians,
          consisting of a principal performer (usually a vocalist), a melodic
          accompaniment (usually a violin), a rhythm accompaniment (usually a
          mridangam), and a tambura, which acts as a drone throughout the
          performance. Other typical instruments used in performances may
          include the ghatam, kanjira, morsing, venu flute, veena, and
          chitraveena. The greatest concentration of Carnatic musicians is to be
          found in the city of Chennai.Various Carnatic music festivals are held
          throughout India and abroad, including the Madras Music Season, which
          has been considered to be one of the world's largest cultural events.

        <p>
          Śruti commonly refers to musical pitch. It is the approximate
          equivalent of a tonic (or less precisely a key) in Western music; it
          is the note from which all the others are derived. It is also used in
          the sense of graded pitches in an octave. While there are an infinite
          number of sounds falling within a scale (or raga) in Carnatic music,
          the number that can be distinguished by auditory perception is
          twenty-two (although over the years, several of them have converged).
          In this sense, while sruti is determined by auditory perception, it is
          also an expression in the listener's mind.

          Swara refers to a type of musical sound that is a single note, which
          defines a relative (higher or lower) position of a note, rather than a
          defined frequency. Swaras also refer to the solfege of Carnatic music,
          which consist of seven notes, "sa-ri-ga-ma-pa-da-ni" (compare with the
          Hindustani sargam: sa-re-ga-ma-pa-dha-ni or Western
          do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti). These names are abbreviations of the longer
          names shadja, rishabha, gandhara, madhyama, panchama, dhaivata and
          nishada. Unlike other music systems, every member of the solfege
          (called a swara) has three variants. The exceptions are the drone
          notes, shadja and panchama (also known as the tonic and the dominant),
          which have only one form; and madhyama (the subdominant), which has
          two forms.

        <p>
          A raga in Carnatic music prescribes a set of rules for building a
          melody – very similar to the Western concept of mode. It specifies
          rules for movements up (aarohanam) and down (avarohanam), the scale of
          which notes should figure more and which notes should be used more
          sparingly, which notes may be sung with gamaka (ornamentation), which
          phrases should be used or avoided, and so on. In effect, it is a
          series of obligatory musical events which must be observed, either
          absolutely or with a particular frequency.In Carnatic music, the
          sampoorna ragas (those with all seven notes in their scales) are
          classified into a system called the melakarta, which groups them
          according to the kinds of notes that they have. There are seventy-two
          melakarta ragas, thirty six of whose madhyama (subdominant) is shuddha
          (perfect fourth from the tonic), the remaining thirty-six of whose
          madhyama (subdominant) is prati (an augmented fourth from the tonic).
          The ragas are grouped into sets of six, called chakras ("wheels",
          though actually segments in the conventional representation) grouped
          according to the supertonic and mediant scale degrees. There is a
          system known as the katapayadi sankhya to determine the names of
          melakarta ragas. Ragas may be divided into two classes: janaka ragas
          (i.e. melakarta or parent ragas) and janya ragas (descendant ragas of
          a particular janaka raga). Janya ragas are themselves subclassified
          into various categories.

        <header id="talam">Talam</header>
        <p>
          Tala refers to a fixed time cycle or metre, set for a particular
          composition, which is built from groupings of beats.[citation needed]
          Talas have cycles of a defined number of beats and rarely change
          within a song. They have specific components, which in combinations
          can give rise to the variety to exist (over 108), allowing different
          compositions to have different rhythms.Carnatic music singers usually
          keep the beat by moving their hands up and down in specified patterns,
          and using their fingers simultaneously to keep time. Tala is formed
          with three basic parts (called angas) which are laghu, dhrtam, and
          anudhrtam, though complex talas may have other parts like plutam,
          guru, and kaakapaadam. There are seven basic tala groups which can be
          formed from the laghu, dhrtam, and anudhrtam:

        <p>
          Improvisation in raga is the soul of Indian classical music – an
          essential aspect."Manodharma Sangeetam" or "kalpana Sangeetam" ("music
          of imagination") as it is known in Carnatic music, embraces several
          varieties of improvisation. The main traditional forms of
          improvisation in Carnatic music consist of the following:

          <header id="raagaalapana">Raga Alapana</header>
          <p>
            An alapana, sometimes also called ragam,is the exposition of a raga
            or tone – a slow improvisation with no rhythm, where the raga acts
            as the basis of embellishment. In performing alapana, performers
            consider each raga as an object that has beginnings and endings and
            consists somehow of sequences of thought. The performer will explore
            the ragam and touch on its various nuances, singing in the lower
            octaves first, then gradually moving up to higher octaves, while
            giving a hint of the song to be performed. Theoretically, this ought
            to be the easiest type of improvisation, since the rules are so few,
            but in fact, it takes much skill to sing a pleasing, comprehensive
            (in the sense of giving a "feel for the ragam") and, most
            importantly, original raga alapana.

          <header id="niraval">Niraval</header>
          <p>
            Niraval, usually performed by the more advanced performers, consists
            of singing one or two lines of text of a song repeatedly, but with a
            series of melodic improvised elaborations. Although niraval consists
            of extempore melodic variations, generally, the original patterns of
            duration are maintained; each word in the lines of text stay set
            within their original place (idam) in the tala cycle. The lines are
            then also played at different levels of speed which can include
            double speed, triple speed, quadruple speed and even sextuple
            speed.[38] The improvised elaborations are made with a view of
            outlining the raga, the tempo, and the theme of the composition.

          <p>
            Kalpanaswaram, also known as swarakalpana, consists of improvising
            melodic and rhythmic passages using swaras (solfa syllables). Like
            niraval, kalpanaswaras are sung to end on a particular swara in the
            raga of the melody and at a specific place (idam) in the tala cycle.
            Kalpanaswaras have a somewhat predictable rhythmical structure; the
            swaras are sung to end on the samam (the first beat of the
            rhythmical cycle). The swaras can also be sung at the same speed or
            double the speed of the melody that is being sung, though some
            artists sing triple-speed phrases too. Kalpanaswaram is the most
            elementary type of improvisation, usually taught before any other
            form of improvisation.

          <p>
            Ragam, Tanam, and Pallavi are the principal long form in
            concerts,and is a composite form of improvisation. As the name
            suggests, it consists of raga alapana, tanam, and a pallavi line.
            Set to a slow-paced tala, the pallavi line is often composed by the
            performer. Through niraval, the performer manipulates the pallavi
            line in complex melodic and rhythmic ways. The niraval is followed
            by kalpanaswarams.

            Tani Avartanam refers to the extended solo that is played by the
            percussionists in a concert, and is usually played after the main
            composition in a concert. The percussionist displays the full range
            of his skills and rhythmic imagination during the solo, which may
            take from two to twenty minutes.[44]
